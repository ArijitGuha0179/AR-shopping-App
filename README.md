## PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are over 1.43 million companies across the nation. In today's world, most people prefer to shop online. However, they frequently become perplexed when shopping online about their exact requirements for the items, such as the range of sizes which differ from one company to another, or whether any furniture or other equipment will fit in their space, or if any design will suit in their walls,and so on. On browsing through apps such as Amazon or Flipkart we come across a multitude of products ranging in all varieties. Suppose a person wants to buy furniture to decorate their house. In such a case they will prefer to view if a particular piece of furniture fits and looks good in the allotted space in their home. But this is not possible in online shopping due to which Users often get confused about the size and the design which they should buy. The same goes on while buying equipment like dresses and shoes. The sizes often vary from one company to another. 

## SOLUTION AND METHODOLOGY
To overcome with the issues of online marketing, our team has come up with a solution of AR based application. We have build an AR app in which the User can view the 3D models of various products that are available online for an User to buy. These 3D models will be viewed in the Users’ own environment, thus giving an interactive experience of a real-world environment with the objects that the User will buy. The App will consist of an option for the User to buy the items which they have viewed in the augmented reality environment. The AR application will portray the product in real world, which would give a clear idea to the customer about the product he is going to buy. On clicking on the “Buy This Item” button, the User will be redirected to the Website where they can place their orders and buy the product.


### [App Demo]()

## TECH STACK
* Unity
* Vuforia
* Python
* VS Studio
* React

## SCALABILITY OF THE APPLICATION
When any new product will be added to e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart, the image of the product will be detected by object detection models. These models will be trained by the use of deep learning and neural networks. This image will then be converted into 3D model using a DIB-R paper within PyTorch library. This 3D model will be used inside the AR environment in the app. The User can view the object in a real-time environment and they proceed to buy the product if they are satisfied with the results.
